# Psychometric Post-Data Analysis for Jamovi

This module is a tool for performing Psychometric Post-Data Analysis.

The current tools available are:

- *Binary Differential Item Functioning* (D.DIF): 

   Assessing DIF on dichotomously scored items using a generalized linear model framework (GLIM). By incorporating the GLIM family of methods for detecting DIF in a user-friendly interface, the technical barrier to assessing DIF has been greatly reduced. The development of techniques for assessing of Type-M error rates (Gelman & Carlin, 2014) on DIF-classification thresholds represents a revolution in the interpretability of DIF-flagging, particularly in the context of low-powered research settings. The goal developing this module is to encourage the use of the the GLIM framework in the broader psychosocial measure validation praxis.

- *T-Test for Mean differences*:

  Implements Type-S, Type-M error rate calculations, and sensitivity analysis for T-Tests of mean differences.

- *T-Test for Correlations*:

  Implements Type-S, Type-M error rate calculations, and sensitivity analysis for T-Tests of Pearson correlations.

To be added:

- Chi^2 Test Type-S/Type-M
- Everything else
